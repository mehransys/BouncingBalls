Bubble Shooter

This is a bubble shooter game built in C++ and SDL2, offering a classic arcade experience with a rich set of features and customization options.

Features:

Multiple Game Modes: Choose your challenge with three distinct modes: "Normal" for a standard session, "Infinite" where new bubble rows continuously appear, and "Timer" to race against the clock for a high score.

Adjustable Difficulty: Tailor the game to your skill level by selecting one of three difficulty settings: "Easy," "Standard," or "Difficult."

High Score Tracking: The game saves your performance with a persistent high score system. You can enter your username, and your score is saved to a file. A dedicated "Scores" screen displays a sorted list of all top scores.

Visual Theming: Customize your experience with three different visual themes. The settings menu allows you to switch between "Jungle," "Dotted," and "Purple" themes, each with unique backgrounds and UI elements.

Complete Audio Control: A comprehensive settings menu provides full control over the game's audio. You can adjust the master volume, mute the sound entirely, and select from three different background music tracks.

Persistent Preferences: Your chosen theme and music track preferences are saved locally, so your settings are automatically loaded the next time you play.

Full Menu System: The game features a complete and robust UI for navigation, including a main menu, a detailed settings screen, a score table, a game start menu (for mode/difficulty selection), an in-game pause menu, and a game over screen.
